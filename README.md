Wordpress Timber Theme for SPARC instruments website

WordPress theme based on the Timber starter theme. Meant to reflect the appearance of other SSEC/CIMSS sites and will likely change to reflect that.
This theme is meant to serve a site with a similar structure to the SPARC set of instruments. SPARC (SSEC Portable Atmospheric Research Center) is a
research trailer with various research instruments on it. The trailer is driven to various locations for research experiments. So the general structure of
a WordPress site using this theme should be:

- Home
- Instruments
  - Instrument 1
  - Instrument 2
- Experiments
  - Experiment 1
  - Experiment 2
    - Daily Status
    - Quicklooks
    - Other

If your site doesn't have this general structure, then this theme probably doesn't make much sense.
